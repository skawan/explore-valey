        <p>
          For many, stepping into Kathmandu is a pupil-dilating experience, a
          riot of sights, sounds and smells that can quickly lead to sensory
          overload. Whether you’re barrelling through the traffic-jammed
          alleyways of the old town in a rickshaw, marvelling at the medieval
          temples or dodging trekking touts in the backpacker districts of
          Kathmandu valley can be an intoxicating, amazing and exhausting place.

          <h3 class="post-title">Bhaktapur</h3>

          <div class="post-body">
            <p>
              Bhaktapur is undoubtedly the most stunning royal town in the
              country of Nepal. Within its vicinity are endless temples adorned
              by unique sculptures, making Bhaktapur enjoyable. Going around it
              enables you to marvel at its spiritual energy. The architecture
              and carved balconies manifest that there are stories behind its
              beauty. But, of course, every street you walk on and every
              structure you see showcases the town’s glorious past. You will
              never run out of fascinating temples to visit or sights to behold.
              This small town, located less than an hour away from the capital,
              has many things to offer. It is a well-preserved area in Nepal.
              The sights and temples you visit remain untainted from modern
              touch. More than that, the town is car-free, allowing you to walk
              on the cobbled streets freely. The city is a living museum where
              arts and style blended well with its spiritual vibe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Bhaktapur is a small town in Newars, formerly called ‘Khwopa.’ The
              oldest name of Bhaktapur is ‘Khwopring.’ It is a non-Sanskrit name
              that evolved multiple times. Bhaktapur was initially called
              Khwopring, then Khwopa, and even Bhadgaon. Many inscriptions
              provide evidence that the Bhaktapur has existed since 477 BCE. It
              means that Bhaktapur is one of the oldest settlements in the
              Kathmandu valley. Moreover, it is a classic town, given the
              evolution of its name alone. However, in recent times, people of
              Nepal still call it Khwopa, while some Bhadgaon. Nevertheless,
              whichever one calls it, Bhaktapur is an ancient town worth
              visiting.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this royal town, cultural heritage and historical sites are
              still on display. Once you see it the first time, you will see the
              simplicity of Nepali life. You will see how the people are deeply
              connected with their past.

          <div class="post-body">
            <p>
              Kathmandu (काठमाडौँ) is the largest city and capital of Nepal and
              the namesake of the Kathmandu Valley. Once thought to be the
              fabled and inaccessible Shangri-La, Kathmandu is now a hub for
              independent travellers as well as a growing vacation spot catering
              to all budgets. As a result of considerable urban growth in recent
              decades, it is now part of one continuous urban area together with
              Patan to the south and Bhaktapur to the east. You will enjoy
              clear, blue sky and white mountains from any famous sites, of
              which it has many: a whopping seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites
              within few miles!
            </p>

            <p>
              Kathmandu is the gateway to tourism in Nepal. It is also the nerve
              center of the country's economy. It has the most advanced
              infrastructure of any urban area in Nepal, and its economy is
              focused on tourism, which accounted for 3.8% of Nepal's GDP in
              1995–96. Tourism in Kathmandu declined thereafter during a period
              of political unrest, but since then has improved. In 2013,
              Kathmandu was ranked third among the top 10 travel destinations on
              the rise in the world by TripAdvisor,and ranked first in Asia.
            </p>

            <p>
              The city has a rich history, spanning nearly 2000 years, as
              inferred from inscriptions found in the valley. Religious and
              cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people
              residing in Kathmandu. Most of Kathmandu's people follow Hinduism
              and many others follow Buddhism. There are people of other
              religious beliefs as well, giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan
              culture. Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city.
              English is understood by Kathmandu's educated residents.

          <div class="post-body">
            <p>
              More popularly known as Patan, Lalitpur is considered the arts and
              architectural capital of Nepal. Situated just across the Bagmati
              River, which separates it from the country’s capital, Kathmandu,
              Lalitpur boasts some of the finest temples, monuments and palaces
              in the country. The city has churned out many artists and artisans
              over the centuries, since its inception as one of the prominent
              Nepali kingdoms. The muted tones of the temple walls almost take
              you back in time, while the stores and hawkers dealing in
              handicrafts outside will tempt you to empty your wallet. But worry
              not, as most stores in and around the city are fair-trade shops,
              promising you value for money. A number of fine restaurants and
              eateries are also spread across the city, especially around the
              Durbar Square, which sees the highest density of tourists in
              almost any season. Despite its location in Asia’s third poorest
              country, the quaint and charming city of Lalitpur offers a rich
              experience to discerning travelers.
            </p>

            <p>
              To really get a feel of the city, stroll around at a leisurely
              pace and shop at the fair-price shops around Durbar Square, where
              you will find beautifully crafted handicrafts at extremely
              attractive prices. Foodies will also be satisfied with the
              numerous eateries and restaurants in the region that mainly cater
              to tourists.
            </p>
