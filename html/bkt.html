            lies above the Pilot Baba Ashram, Gymape Danda. This hill station
            immensely satisfies you with the field vision of the trio artistic
            burghs of Nepal i.e. Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur itself.
            OUTLINES OF CONTENTS Ranikot: a blend of nature and adventure
            Ranikot Fort Baghbhairava temple at Ranikot Ranikot, today is
            emerging as one of the most popular hiking destinations within the

          <h3>Kalamasi, Nagarkot</h3>

          <p>
            Kalamasi, the artificial lake of Bhaktapur is also known as the
            Bojini dam site and picnic spot. That artificial lake is actually a
            barricade surrounded by the jungle. Thus, you can enjoy the fresh
            air and sound flow of the natural stream over there. The place is
            located roughly near Muhan pokhari. And, that near costs around
            10-15 minutes of drive. There is even a small trail within the
            jungle that ultimately collabs with the Deurali hiking trail. Thus,
            you can start another hike from there. It surely is a perfect place
            for those who don’t even want to have a glimpse of the city. Cause,
            you would be in the middle of woods and dam on your side.

          <h3>Taumadhi Square</h3>

          <p>
            Located right next to the famous Durbar Square, Taumadhi square is
            often left unnoticed while travelling to Bhaktapur but one has to
            explore it in order to know about ancient legends and adore ancient
            architecture. The square is very popular among tourists because of
            the beautifully structured stones and carvings on the wood. The
            stone sculptures are a major attraction in this square. It
            represents the ancient life in Bhaktapur. Also known as Taumadi
            Tole, it owes much of its reputation to be the site for Nyatapola
            Temple, the tallest temple in Nepal towering to a height of 30
            metres.

          <h3>Siddhapokhari</h3>

          <p>
            Siddha Pokhari is one of the oldest and the largest ponds of
            Bhaktapur. Locally interpreted as Ta; Pukhu means the big pond, some
            study says it is a natural pool while some say it is a manmade pond.
            But, it still has a great name in Bhaktapur. People of almost all
            ages go there. Besides, it has religious importance too. During the
            Indra jatra, a jatra associated with Indrayani is done over there
            where the diyos are lit up all around the pond. The night view of
            that pond, simultaneously on that day looks immensely beautiful like
            a night of Tihar. All lighted up and bright.

          <h3>Changu Narayan</h3>

          <p>
            Changu Narayan is a synonymous word with both the old Nepalese
            temple and the village that surrounds it. Located in the Bhaktapur
            district some 12 km east of Kathmandu, Changu Narayan is the oldest
            temple in Nepal and has an authentic Newari style architecture very
            true to its roots. With its two-storey brick-red edifice, the
            beautiful temple perches atop a hill which is also called Changu or
            sometimes Dolagiri. The Changu Narayan temple is devoted to Lord
            Vishnu and houses several of his avatars and some other deities as
            well. And like every other Hindu temple in the subcontinent, this
            temple too has two separate faiths regarding its past – one
            corresponds with the recorded history as we know it and another one
            is a legend as told by the local folklore. Surrounding Changu
            Narayan are dense woods of Champak tree, and this forest plays an
            important role in the legends associated with the temple.
