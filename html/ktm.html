          <h3>Taudaha Lake, Chobar</h3>

          <p>
            Situated on the outskirts of Kathmandu in in Chobar,, Taudaha Lake
            is the perfect place to have a peaceful timeby yourself or with your
            friends. With an incongruously solitary tree in the middle of the
            large water pool, Taudaha also has a variety of fish and migratory
            birds. Taudaha Lake, some 6 km southwest of Kathmandu, not only
            holds cultural significance but is also important for its rich
            diversity of flora and fauna. According to experts, it is the
            valley’s only remaining natural lake that still serves as a habitat
            for a significant number of wetland birds and so is valuable from
            the ecological point of view. The name, Taudaha, comes from a
            combination of Newari words 'Ta', meaning snake and 'Daha', which
            means lake.

          <h3>Garden of Dreams</h3>

          <p>
            Garden of Dreams in Kathmandu, also referred to as the 'Swapna
            Bageecha' and 'garden of six seasons is a neo-classical garden in
            Kathmandu built by Kishore Narshingh in1920. The garden has a
            magnificent amphitheatre, urns, gorgeous pavilions, paved perimeter
            paths, pergolas, and ponds that draw in locals and tourists alike.
            After the patron of this garden, Kaiser Sumsher Rana, passed away in
            the 1960s, the site lay in neglect until recent years, when it was
            beautifully restored by the Austrian government and reopened for
            visitors.
