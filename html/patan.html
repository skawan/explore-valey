          <h3>Royal Palace Patan</h3>

          <p>
            The Royal Palace in Patan covers up the Durbar Square in the city
            and is one of the most famous attractions there. Built in the 14th
            century under the rule of the Malla King, the palace was restored
            after the Kathmandu earthquake in 2015. The palace includes a number
            of temples in its complex and it is almost impossible to take a trip
            to Durbar Square without having a look at the Royal Palace. The
            palace has a series of connecting courtyards behind the windows,
            overhanging eaves and delicate wooden screens. The northern gateway
            has been engraved with golden Toranas showing Parvati, Shiva,
            Ganesha and Kumar. Above the gateway, there is a window that is
            gilded foil wrapped around a timber frame where the king used to
            make his public appearances. This place also leads to the Patan
            Museum.

          <h3>Durbar Square Patan</h3>

          <p>
            This UNESCO heritage site, located in the centre of Lalitpur is one
            of the most visited places in Nepal. The architecture and history
            can be seen in the temples, palaces and houses and best reflect the
            culture of this country. Located just a few kilometres from
            Kathmandu City, the Durbar Square Patan is one of the three main
            Durbar Squares in Kathmandu Valley and offers a perfect blend
            between ancient history and culture along with modern local street
            food. The best time to visit Durbar Square Patan is from October to
            December in order to have the best outdoor experience. It is often
            overcrowded during the weekends so it is best to visit during the
            weekdays. Unfortunately, a lot of this area was destroyed during the
            2015 earthquake, leading to it being seen as an unattractive place
            to visit. However, over the years, the government, as well as the
            community, have been putting in their efforts to rebuild this area,
            making Patan one of the most artistic Buddhist cities in the world
            and the Durbar Square a must-visit attraction in Nepal.
